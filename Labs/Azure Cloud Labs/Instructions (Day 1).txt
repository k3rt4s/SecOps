0. Delete Everything by Deleting your Resource Group
*Everything will be built in West3
1. Create a Resource Group called "Red-Team"
2. Create a Vnet, keeping the subnet the same, with the name "Red-Team"
3. Create an NSG called Vnet
4. Place a Default / Implict Deny in place 
5. Associate the NSG to the Vnet
6. Build your first VM
	Name: JumpBox
	Image: Ubuntu
	Size: B1s
	Auth: SSH Public Key
	UN: azureuser
	SSH Public Key Source: Use Existing Public Key
	SSH Public Key: Use Key generated in GitBash (See below for SSH key Instructions)
	Public Inbound ports: Allow Selected ports
	Inbound Ports: SSH (22) 
		*We are going to use SSH to connect to the server
	Select Networking Tab
	NIC Security Group: None
	Click to create and build the server
7. After, Allow SSH to the server
	by navigating to the NSG and adding an inbound port rule
	Source: IP Addresses
	Source IP: Your PUBLIC IP address
	Destination: IP Addresses
	Destination IP: Private IP of your Jumpbox VM
	Service: SSH
	Priority: 110
	Name: Jumpbox-Access
	click to create
8. Test Connecting to the VM
	Using gitbash run ssh azureuser@JUMPBOX-PUBLIC-IP
	* You can find the public IP on your jumpbox's status page
	If you connect successfully, your prompt will be azureuser@Jumpbox:~$
9. Build two Web Servers next
	Each VM should be named "Web-1" and "Web-2"
	Same Resource Group
	Image: Ubuntu
	Size: B1s
	Auth: SSH Public Key
	UN: azureuser
	SSH Public Key Source: Use Existing Public Key
	SSH Public Key: Use Key generated in GitBash (See below for SSH key Instructions)
	Public Inbound ports: None
	*We will use the jumpbox to connect to them
	Inbound Ports: None
	Select Networking Tab
	NIC Security Group: None
	Click to create and build each server

	
** SSH Key Gen Instructions
1. Open Gitbash or Terminal
2. Run ssh-keygen keeping defaults and setting a passphrase
3. Run cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to display your id_rsa.pub key
4. Highlight and copy the SSH key string to your clipboard.
* LEAVE THE LAST PIECE THAT CONTAINS LAPTOP INFORMATION OFF. EXAMPLE BELOW
ssh-rsa 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
